# Nibiru

Nibiru is a rapid prototyping framework written in PHP and based on the MVC design pattern. Now one may say that writing another framework is not cool because there are so many, such as Symphony, ZendFramework ( where as I have prefered the first version of that framework ), Laravel, etc.. But let's be honest they are complete overkill for smaller projects and are not fit to quick start your "own" development.

That is why I have started my own little framework and am happy to provide the first version of Nibiru, in the version 0.1, there is still a lot of work to be done in refactoring the core features for the View, Controller and the main Template Engine Implementation.

But for now the start is done. And always remember, have fun!
